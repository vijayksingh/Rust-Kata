# Rust Kata

## Description

This is a kata to learn Rust. Tried to mimic rustlings.
This is to pick up rust syntax and concepts (iterator and vector methods).

Methods covered:

- map
- flat_map
- filter
- collect
- iter
- for_each
- fold

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `RUSTFLAGS="--allow dead_code" cargo tests` to run all tests

## Possible improvements

- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add more exercises (reduce is missing)
- [ ] Cover standard library
  - [ ] Sequence (Vec, VecDeque, LinkedList)
  - [ ] Maps (HashMap, BTreeMap)
  - [ ] Sets (HashSet, BTreeSet)
  - [ ] Misc (BinaryHeap)
